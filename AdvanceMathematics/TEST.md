## General
18 in total: 14 multi-choices each is 3 marks, 4 free text , 2 of them 18 marks each, and the other two 6 marks each. total is 90 marks.

## Topics  
- Fourier series
- Eigenvalue and eigenvectors
- Integrals
- Gini value
- Triple integral
- Computing work done along a path.

## Tips
- Start with the long questions
- Do de examples of the classes on thursday, they make some examples than you can use it to study
## Examples of questions
1) Differentiate f(x) = ln(tan(x))


Answer:

f'(x) = (1/cos^2) * (1/tan(x))

 
 

2) Evaluate the integral int (4+5x)^-3dx

Answer:

int (u)^-3 du

u = (4+5x)

du = 5 dx

1/5 * du = dx

1/5 * int (u)^-3 du

1/5 * (-1/2) * u^-2 

-1/10 * (4+5x)^-2 + C

 
 

3) Find the first order partial derivates of f(x, y) = x^3y - e^(xy)

Answers:

f' (with respect to x) = 3*x^2 * y - y * e^(xy)

f' (with respect to y) = x^3 - x * e^(xy)

 

 

4) Show that AB unequal BA:

Answer:

A * B =

2x2 matrix with (

0 -1

1  0 )

 

B * A =

2x2 matrix with ( 

0 1

-1 0 )

 

Thus, AB unequal BA

 

5) Find the inverse of A:

A^-1 = 1/det(A) * C^T
 

det(A) = -2

 

-(1/2) * C^T
 

C = 

2x2 matrix (

4 -3

-2 1)
 

C^T =

2x2 matrix (

4 -2

-3 1)

 

A^-1 = -(1/2) * C^T

6) Find some taylor series expresions
